This is a text based pokemon game.


Things to do:
1. Walk around (Remember to look at the map.pdf file the game comes with!) 
2. Catch pokemon
3. Heal and buy items
4. Challenge pokemon Trainers
5. Catch Legendaries
6. Defeat all 5 gyms
7. Defeat elite four and win the game!
8. Brag to your friends and have a great time


Things to be aware of!
1. If a pokemon dies it is lost forever!
2. Many features of the game is still in development (gyms, elitefour, surgery, moves)
3. Remember to save often. The game can crash.
4. Don’t go to a highlevel-zone too quickly. You will die :p
5. There are MANY bugs! I didn’t even try to remove the non-game-breaking ones.


Things that are (near) identical to the real pokemon games:
1. Pokemon stats (EV and IV is set to average on all)
2. Exp gain and level. It takes 1 000 000 exp to get to level 100.
3. Catch rates are identical +-1%
4. Type chart

Things that are simplified:
1. Moves (only attack damage currently)
2. Money gain from Trainers.
3. Enemy Trainer AI is random
4. Only a few Items exists and only potions and ball are currently working.
